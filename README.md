# atomicApe
## Always fresh. Always bananas.
Atom meets Babun in this repository optimized for running various forms of development software on a flash drive on Windows. Download one of the releases and unzip the folder *directly* to `MYDRIVELETTER:\atomicApe` or run `cd MYDRIVELETTER:\ && git clone https://github.com/justathoughtor2/atomicApe.git`. Note that the reason the developer recommends using the flash drive directly is due to the Windows pathname character limit.

You may contact justathoughtor2 with any questions or comments at [atomicape@justathoughtor2.com](mailto:atomicape@justathoughtor2.com).

## Actually running the software
To start the atomicApe Babun terminal, double click on the file `babun.bat` in the root directory of the unzipped folder. To start Atom, run the command `./atom.bat` from within the Babun terminal. Note that this will occupy the terminal until you close Atom, so you might want to open another terminal with ALT+F2 (from within the first terminal). To run Python or GCC, just run either `python` or `gcc` in the terminal (respectively). To run Node.js or NPM, run `./node` or `./npm.cmd` (respectively). To run Ruby or RubyGems, run `Ruby22/bin/ruby` or `Ruby22/bin/gem.bat` (respectively). To start UwAmp, run `UwAmp/UwAmp`.
