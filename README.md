# atomicApe
## Always fresh. Always bananas.
Atom meets Babun in this repository optimized for running various forms of development software on a flash drive on Windows. Download one of the releases and unzip the folder *directly* to `MYDRIVELETTER:\atomicApe` or run `cd MYDRIVELETTER:\ && git clone https://github.com/justathoughtor2/atomicApe.git`. Note that the reason the developer recommends using the flash drive directly is due to the Windows pathname character limit.

You may contact justathoughtor2 with any questions or comments at [bananas@atomicape.xyz](mailto:bananas@atomicape.xyz).
