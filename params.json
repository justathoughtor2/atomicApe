Always bananas.\r\nAtom meets Babun in this repository optimized for running various forms of development software on a flash drive on Windows. Download one of the releases and unzip the folder *directly* to `MYDRIVELETTER:\\atomicApe` or run `cd MYDRIVELETTER: && git clone https://github.com/justathoughtor2/atomicApe.git` from within a Git Bash instance. Note that the reason justathoughtor2 recommends using the flash drive directly is due to the Windows pathname character limit.\r\n\r\nYou may contact justathoughtor2 with any questions or comments at [atomicape@justathoughtor2.com](mailto:atomicape@justathoughtor2.com).\r\n\r\n### Actually running the software\r\nTo start the atomicApe Babun terminal, double click on the file `babun.bat` in the root directory of the unzipped folder. To start Atom, run the command `./atom.bat` from within the Babun terminal. Note that this will occupy the terminal until you close Atom, so you might want to open another terminal with ALT+F2 (from within the first terminal). To run Python or GCC, just run either `python` or `gcc` in the terminal (respectively). To run Node.js or NPM, run `./node` or `./npm.cmd` (respectively). To run Ruby or RubyGems, run `Ruby22/bin/ruby` or `Ruby22/bin/gem.bat` (respectively). To start UwAmp, run `UwAmp/UwAmp`.\r\n\r\n## Currently included software:\r\n+ [Atom v1.4.3](https://atom.io/)\r\n+ [Babun v1.2.0](https://github.com/babun/babun)\r\n+ [Cygwin v2.4.1](https://cygwin.com/)\r\n+ [GCC v4.9.3](https://gcc.gnu.org/)\r\n+ [Python v2.7.10](https://www.python.org/)\r\n+ [Pelican v3.6.3](http://blog.getpelican.com/)\r\n+ [Ruby v2.2.4 and RubyGems v2.4.5.1](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)\r\n+ [Jekyll v3.1.1](https://jekyllrb.com/)\r\n+ [Node.js v4.2.6 and NPM v1.4.9](https://nodejs.org/en/)\r\n+ [Forever v0.15.1](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever)\r\n+ [Bower v1.7.6](https://github.com/bower/bower)\r\n+ [UwAmp v3.0.2](http://www.uwamp.com/en/)\r\n+ [Apache v2.4.10](http://www.apache.org/)\r\n+ [MySQL v5.6.20](https://www.mysql.com/)\r\n+ [PHP v5.4.31](https://secure.php.net/)\r\n+ [phpMyAdmin v4.2.7.1](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/)\r\n","google":"UA-47460054-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
