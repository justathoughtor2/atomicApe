NAME
    IO::Prompt::Tiny - Prompt for user input with a default option

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
      use IO::Prompt::Tiny qw/prompt/;

      my $answer = prompt("Yes or no? (y/n)", "n");

DESCRIPTION
    This is an extremely simple prompting module, based on the extremely
    simple prompt offered by ExtUtils::MakeMaker.In many cases, that's all
    you need and this module gives it to you without all the overhead of
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker just to prompt for input.

    It doesn't do any validation, coloring, menus, timeouts, or any of the
    wild, crazy, cool stuff that other prompting modules do. It just prompts
    with a default. That's it!

USAGE
    The following function may be explicitly imported. No functions are
    imported by default.

  prompt
        my $value = prompt($message);
        my $value = prompt($message, $default);

    The prompt() function displays the message as a prompt for input and
    returns the (chomped) response from the user, or the default if the
    response was empty.

    If the program is not running interactively or if the
    PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT environment variable is set to true, the default
    will be used without prompting.

    If no default is provided, an empty string will be used instead.

    Unlike ExtUtils::MakeMaker::prompt(), this prompt() does not use
    prototypes, so this will work as expected:

      my @args = ($prompt, $default);
      prompt(@args);

ENVIRONMENT
  PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT
    If set to a true value, IO::Prompt::Tiny will always return the default
    without waiting for user input, just like ExtUtils::MakeMaker does.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
    The guts of this module are based on ExtUtils::MakeMaker and
    IO::Interactive::Tiny (which is based on IO::Interactive). Thank you to
    the authors of those modules.
