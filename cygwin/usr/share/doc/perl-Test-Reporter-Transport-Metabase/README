NAME
    Test::Reporter::Transport::Metabase - Metabase transport for
    Test::Reporter

VERSION
    version 1.999009

SYNOPSIS
        my $report = Test::Reporter->new(
            transport => 'Metabase',
            transport_args => [
              uri     => 'http://metabase.example.com:3000/',
              id_file => '/home/jdoe/.metabase/metabase_id.json',
            ],
        );

        # use space-separated in a CPAN::Reporter config.ini
        transport = Metabase uri http://metabase.example.com:3000/ ...

DESCRIPTION
    This module submits a Test::Reporter report to the specified Metabase
    instance.

    This requires a network connection to the Metabase uri provided. If you
    wish to save reports during offline operation, see
    Test::Reporter::Transport::File. (Eventually, you may be able to run a
    local Metabase instance to queue reports for later transmission, but
    this feature has not yet been developed.)

USAGE
    See Test::Reporter and Test::Reporter::Transport for general usage
    information.

  Transport arguments
    Unlike most other Transport classes, this class requires transport
    arguments to be provided as key-value pairs:

        my $report = Test::Reporter->new(
            transport => 'Metabase',
            transport_args => [
              uri     => 'http://metabase.example.com:3000/',
              id_file => '/home/jdoe/.metabase/metabase_id.json',
            ],
        );

    Arguments include:

    "uri" (required)
        The "uri" argument gives the network location of a Metabase instance
        to receive reports.

    "id_file" (required)
        The "id_file" argument must be a path to a Metabase ID file. If you
        do not already have an ID file, use the metabase-profile program to
        create one.

          $ metabase-profile

        This creates the file metabase_id.json in the current directory. You
        can also give an "--output" argument to save the file to a different
        location or with a different name.

    "client" (optional)
        The "client" argument is optional and specifies the type of
        Metabase::Client to use to transmit reports to the target Metabase.
        It defaults to Metabase::Client::Simple.

METHODS
    These methods are only for internal use by Test::Reporter.

  new
        my $sender = Test::Reporter::Transport::File->new( $params );

    The "new" method is the object constructor.

  send
        $sender->send( $report );

    The "send" method transmits the report.
