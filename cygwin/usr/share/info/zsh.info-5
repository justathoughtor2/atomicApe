26.5 Prompt Themes
==================

26.5.1 Installation
-------------------

You should make sure all the functions from the Functions/Prompts
directory of the source distribution are available; they all begin with
the string 'prompt_' except for the special function'promptinit'.  You
also need the 'colors' function from Functions/Misc.  All of these
functions may already have been installed on your system; if not, you
will need to find them and copy them.  The directory should appear as
one of the elements of the fpath array (this should already be the case
if they were installed), and at least the function promptinit should be
autoloaded; it will autoload the rest.  Finally, to initialize the use
of the system you need to call the promptinit function.  The following
code in your .zshrc will arrange for this; assume the functions are
stored in the directory ~/myfns:

     fpath=(~/myfns $fpath)
     autoload -U promptinit
     promptinit

26.5.2 Theme Selection
----------------------

Use the prompt command to select your preferred theme.  This command may
be added to your .zshrc following the call to promptinit in order to
start zsh with a theme already selected.

prompt [ -c | -l ]
prompt [ -p | -h ] [ THEME ... ]
prompt [ -s ] THEME [ ARG ... ]
     Set or examine the prompt theme.  With no options and a THEME
     argument, the theme with that name is set as the current theme.
     The available themes are determined at run time; use the -l option
     to see a list.  The special THEME 'random' selects at random one of
     the available themes and sets your prompt to that.

     In some cases the THEME may be modified by one or more arguments,
     which should be given after the theme name.  See the help for each
     theme for descriptions of these arguments.

     Options are:

     -c
          Show the currently selected theme and its parameters, if any.
     -l
          List all available prompt themes.
     -p
          Preview the theme named by THEME, or all themes if no THEME is
          given.
     -h
          Show help for the theme named by THEME, or for the prompt
          function if no THEME is given.
     -s
          Set THEME as the current theme and save state.

prompt_THEME_setup
     Each available THEME has a setup function which is called by the
     prompt function to install that theme.  This function may define
     other functions as necessary to maintain the prompt, including
     functions used to preview the prompt or provide help for its use.
     You should not normally call a theme's setup function directly.

26.6 ZLE Functions
==================

26.6.1 Widgets
--------------

These functions all implement user-defined ZLE widgets (see *note Zsh
Line Editor::) which can be bound to keystrokes in interactive shells.
To use them, your .zshrc should contain lines of the form

     autoload FUNCTION
     zle -N FUNCTION

followed by an appropriate bindkey command to associate the function
with a key sequence.  Suggested bindings are described below.

bash-style word functions
     If you are looking for functions to implement moving over and
     editing words in the manner of bash, where only alphanumeric
     characters are considered word characters, you can use the
     functions described in the next section.  The following is
     sufficient:

          autoload -U select-word-style
          select-word-style bash

forward-word-match, backward-word-match
kill-word-match, backward-kill-word-match
transpose-words-match, capitalize-word-match
up-case-word-match, down-case-word-match
select-word-style, match-word-context, match-words-by-style
     The eight '-match' functions are drop-in replacements for the
     builtin widgets without the suffix.  By default they behave in a
     similar way.  However, by the use of styles and the function
     select-word-style, the way words are matched can be altered.

     The simplest way of configuring the functions is to use
     select-word-style, which can either be called as a normal function
     with the appropriate argument, or invoked as a user-defined widget
     that will prompt for the first character of the word style to be
     used.  The first time it is invoked, the eight -match functions
     will automatically replace the builtin versions, so they do not
     need to be loaded explicitly.

     The word styles available are as follows.  Only the first character
     is examined.

     bash
          Word characters are alphanumeric characters only.

     normal
          As in normal shell operation: word characters are alphanumeric
          characters plus any characters present in the string given by
          the parameter $WORDCHARS.

     shell
          Words are complete shell command arguments, possibly including
          complete quoted strings, or any tokens special to the shell.

     whitespace
          Words are any set of characters delimited by whitespace.

     default
          Restore the default settings; this is usually the same as
          'normal'.

     All but 'default' can be input as an upper case character, which
     has the same effect but with subword matching turned on.  In this
     case, words with upper case characters are treated specially: each
     separate run of upper case characters, or an upper case character
     followed by any number of other characters, is considered a word.
     The style subword-range can supply an alternative character range
     to the default '[:upper:]'; the value of the style is treated as
     the contents of a '[...]' pattern (note that the outer brackets
     should not be supplied, only those surrounding named ranges).

     More control can be obtained using the zstyle command, as described
     in *note The zsh/zutil Module::.  Each style is looked up in the
     context :zle:WIDGET where WIDGET is the name of the user-defined
     widget, not the name of the function implementing it, so in the
     case of the definitions supplied by select-word-style the
     appropriate contexts are :zle:forward-word, and so on.  The
     function select-word-style itself always defines styles for the
     context ':zle:*' which can be overridden by more specific (longer)
     patterns as well as explicit contexts.

     The style word-style specifies the rules to use.  This may have the
     following values.

     normal
          Use the standard shell rules, i.e.  alphanumerics and
          $WORDCHARS, unless overridden by the styles word-chars or
          word-class.

     specified
          Similar to normal, but _only_ the specified characters, and
          not also alphanumerics, are considered word characters.

     unspecified
          The negation of specified.  The given characters are those
          which will _not_ be considered part of a word.

     shell
          Words are obtained by using the syntactic rules for generating
          shell command arguments.  In addition, special tokens which
          are never command arguments such as '()' are also treated as
          words.

     whitespace
          Words are whitespace-delimited strings of characters.

     The first three of those rules usually use $WORDCHARS, but the
     value in the parameter can be overridden by the style word-chars,
     which works in exactly the same way as $WORDCHARS.  In addition,
     the style word-class uses character class syntax to group
     characters and takes precedence over word-chars if both are set.
     The word-class style does not include the surrounding brackets of
     the character class; for example, '-:[:alnum:]' is a valid
     word-class to include all alphanumerics plus the characters '-' and
     ':'.  Be careful including ']', '^' and '-' as these are special
     inside character classes.

     word-style may also have '-subword' appended to its value to turn
     on subword matching, as described above.

     The style skip-chars is mostly useful for transpose-words and
     similar functions.  If set, it gives a count of characters starting
     at the cursor position which will not be considered part of the
     word and are treated as space, regardless of what they actually
     are.  For example, if

          zstyle ':zle:transpose-words' skip-chars 1

     has been set, and transpose-words-match is called with the cursor
     on the X of fooXbar, where X can be any character, then the
     resulting expression is barXfoo.

     Finer grained control can be obtained by setting the style
     word-context to an array of pairs of entries.  Each pair of entries
     consists of a PATTERN and a SUBCONTEXT.  The shell argument the
     cursor is on is matched against each PATTERN in turn until one
     matches; if it does, the context is extended by a colon and the
     corresponding SUBCONTEXT.  Note that the test is made against the
     original word on the line, with no stripping of quotes.  Special
     handling is done between words: the current context is examined and
     if it contains the string back, the word before the cursor is
     considered, else the word after cursor is considered.  Some
     examples are given below.

     The style skip-whitespace-first is only used with the forward-word
     widget.  If it is set to true, then forward-word skips any
     non-word-characters, followed by any non-word-characters: this is
     similar to the behaviour of other word-orientated widgets, and also
     that used by other editors, however it differs from the standard
     zsh behaviour.  When using select-word-style the widget is set in
     the context :zle:* to true if the word style is bash and false
     otherwise.  It may be overridden by setting it in the more specific
     context :zle:forward-word*.

     Here are some examples of use of the styles, actually taken from
     the simplified interface in select-word-style:

          zstyle ':zle:*' word-style standard
          zstyle ':zle:*' word-chars ''

     Implements bash-style word handling for all widgets, i.e.  only
     alphanumerics are word characters; equivalent to setting the
     parameter WORDCHARS empty for the given context.

          style ':zle:*kill*' word-style space

     Uses space-delimited words for widgets with the word 'kill' in the
     name.  Neither of the styles word-chars nor word-class is used in
     this case.

     Here are some examples of use of the word-context style to extend
     the context.

          zstyle ':zle:*' word-context \
                 "*/*" file "[[:space:]]" whitespace
          zstyle ':zle:transpose-words:whitespace' word-style shell
          zstyle ':zle:transpose-words:filename' word-style normal
          zstyle ':zle:transpose-words:filename' word-chars ''

     This provides two different ways of using transpose-words depending
     on whether the cursor is on whitespace between words or on a
     filename, here any word containing a /.  On whitespace, complete
     arguments as defined by standard shell rules will be transposed.
     In a filename, only alphanumerics will be transposed.  Elsewhere,
     words will be transposed using the default style for
     :zle:transpose-words.

     The word matching and all the handling of zstyle settings is
     actually implemented by the function match-words-by-style.  This
     can be used to create new user-defined widgets.  The calling
     function should set the local parameter curcontext to :zle:WIDGET,
     create the local parameter matched_words and call
     match-words-by-style with no arguments.  On return, matched_words
     will be set to an array with the elements: (1) the start of the
     line (2) the word before the cursor (3) any non-word characters
     between that word and the cursor (4) any non-word character at the
     cursor position plus any remaining non-word characters before the
     next word, including all characters specified by the skip-chars
     style, (5) the word at or following the cursor (6) any non-word
     characters following that word (7) the remainder of the line.  Any
     of the elements may be an empty string; the calling function should
     test for this to decide whether it can perform its function.

     It is possible to pass options with arguments to
     match-words-by-style to override the use of styles.  The options
     are:
     -w
          WORD-STYLE
     -s
          SKIP-CHARS
     -c
          WORD-CLASS
     -C
          WORD-CHARS
     -r
          SUBWORD-RANGE

     For example, match-words-by-style -w shell -c 0 may be used to
     extract the command argument around the cursor.

     The word-context style is implemented by the function
     match-word-context.  This should not usually need to be called
     directly.

copy-earlier-word
     This widget works like a combination of insert-last-word and
     copy-prev-shell-word.  Repeated invocations of the widget retrieve
     earlier words on the relevant history line.  With a numeric
     argument N, insert the Nth word from the history line; N may be
     negative to count from the end of the line.

     If insert-last-word has been used to retrieve the last word on a
     previous history line, repeated invocations will replace that word
     with earlier words from the same line.

     Otherwise, the widget applies to words on the line currently being
     edited.  The widget style can be set to the name of another widget
     that should be called to retrieve words.  This widget must accept
     the same three arguments as insert-last-word.

cycle-completion-positions
     After inserting an unambiguous string into the command line, the
     new function based completion system may know about multiple places
     in this string where characters are missing or differ from at least
     one of the possible matches.  It will then place the cursor on the
     position it considers to be the most interesting one, i.e.  the one
     where one can disambiguate between as many matches as possible with
     as little typing as possible.

     This widget allows the cursor to be easily moved to the other
     interesting spots.  It can be invoked repeatedly to cycle between
     all positions reported by the completion system.

delete-whole-word-match
     This is another function which works like the -match functions
     described immediately above, i.e.  using styles to decide the word
     boundaries.  However, it is not a replacement for any existing
     function.

     The basic behaviour is to delete the word around the cursor.  There
     is no numeric argument handling; only the single word around the
     cursor is considered.  If the widget contains the string kill, the
     removed text will be placed in the cutbuffer for future yanking.
     This can be obtained by defining kill-whole-word-match as follows:

          zle -N kill-whole-word-match delete-whole-word-match

     and then binding the widget kill-whole-word-match.

up-line-or-beginning-search, down-line-or-beginning-search
     These widgets are similar to the builtin functions
     up-line-or-search and down-line-or-search: if in a multiline buffer
     they move up or down within the buffer, otherwise they search for a
     history line matching the start of the current line.  In this case,
     however, they search for a line which matches the current line up
     to the current cursor position, in the manner of
     history-beginning-search-backward and -forward, rather than the
     first word on the line.

edit-command-line
     Edit the command line using your visual editor, as in ksh.

          bindkey -M vicmd v edit-command-line

expand-absolute-path
     Expand the file name under the cursor to an absolute path,
     resolving symbolic links.  Where possible, the initial path segment
     is turned into a named directory or reference to a user's home
     directory.

history-search-end
     This function implements the widgets
     history-beginning-search-backward-end and
     history-beginning-search-forward-end.  These commands work by first
     calling the corresponding builtin widget (see *note History
     Control::) and then moving the cursor to the end of the line.  The
     original cursor position is remembered and restored before calling
     the builtin widget a second time, so that the same search is
     repeated to look farther through the history.

     Although you autoload only one function, the commands to use it are
     slightly different because it implements two widgets.

          zle -N history-beginning-search-backward-end \
                 history-search-end
          zle -N history-beginning-search-forward-end \
                 history-search-end
          bindkey '\e^P' history-beginning-search-backward-end
          bindkey '\e^N' history-beginning-search-forward-end

history-beginning-search-menu
     This function implements yet another form of history searching.
     The text before the cursor is used to select lines from the
     history, as for history-beginning-search-backward except that all
     matches are shown in a numbered menu.  Typing the appropriate
     digits inserts the full history line.  Note that leading zeroes
     must be typed (they are only shown when necessary for removing
     ambiguity).  The entire history is searched; there is no
     distinction between forwards and backwards.

     With a numeric argument, the search is not anchored to the start of
     the line; the string typed by the use may appear anywhere in the
     line in the history.

     If the widget name contains '-end' the cursor is moved to the end
     of the line inserted.  If the widget name contains '-space' any
     space in the text typed is treated as a wildcard and can match
     anything (hence a leading space is equivalent to giving a numeric
     argument).  Both forms can be combined, for example:

          zle -N history-beginning-search-menu-space-end \
                 history-beginning-search-menu

history-pattern-search
     The function history-pattern-search implements widgets which prompt
     for a pattern with which to search the history backwards or
     forwards.  The pattern is in the usual zsh format, however the
     first character may be ^ to anchor the search to the start of the
     line, and the last character may be $ to anchor the search to the
     end of the line.  If the search was not anchored to the end of the
     line the cursor is positioned just after the pattern found.

     The commands to create bindable widgets are similar to those in the
     example immediately above:

          autoload -U history-pattern-search
          zle -N history-pattern-search-backward history-pattern-search
          zle -N history-pattern-search-forward history-pattern-search

incarg
     Typing the keystrokes for this widget with the cursor placed on or
     to the left of an integer causes that integer to be incremented by
     one.  With a numeric argument, the number is incremented by the
     amount of the argument (decremented if the numeric argument is
     negative).  The shell parameter incarg may be set to change the
     default increment to something other than one.

          bindkey '^X+' incarg

incremental-complete-word
     This allows incremental completion of a word.  After starting this
     command, a list of completion choices can be shown after every
     character you type, which you can delete with ^H or DEL.  Pressing
     return accepts the completion so far and returns you to normal
     editing (that is, the command line is _not_ immediately executed).
     You can hit TAB to do normal completion, ^G to abort back to the
     state when you started, and ^D to list the matches.

     This works only with the new function based completion system.

          bindkey '^Xi' incremental-complete-word

insert-composed-char
     This function allows you to compose characters that don't appear on
     the keyboard to be inserted into the command line.  The command is
     followed by two keys corresponding to ASCII characters (there is no
     prompt).  For accented characters, the two keys are a base
     character followed by a code for the accent, while for other
     special characters the two characters together form a mnemonic for
     the character to be inserted.  The two-character codes are a subset
     of those given by RFC 1345 (see for example
     <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1345.html>).

     The function may optionally be followed by up to two characters
     which replace one or both of the characters read from the keyboard;
     if both characters are supplied, no input is read.  For example,
     insert-composed-char a: can be used within a widget to insert an a
     with umlaut into the command line.  This has the advantages over
     use of a literal character that it is more portable.

     For best results zsh should have been built with support for
     multibyte characters (configured with --enable-multibyte); however,
     the function works for the limited range of characters available in
     single-byte character sets such as ISO-8859-1.

     The character is converted into the local representation and
     inserted into the command line at the cursor position.  (The
     conversion is done within the shell, using whatever facilities the
     C library provides.)  With a numeric argument, the character and
     its code are previewed in the status line

     The function may be run outside zle in which case it prints the
     character (together with a newline) to standard output.  Input is
     still read from keystrokes.

     See insert-unicode-char for an alternative way of inserting Unicode
     characters using their hexadecimal character number.

     The set of accented characters is reasonably complete up to Unicode
     character U+0180, the set of special characters less so.  However,
     it is very sporadic from that point.  Adding new characters is
     easy, however; see the function define-composed-chars.  Please send
     any additions to zsh-workers@zsh.org.

     The codes for the second character when used to accent the first
     are as follows.  Note that not every character can take every
     accent.
     !
          Grave.
     '
          Acute.
     >
          Circumflex.
     ?
          Tilde.  (This is not ~ as RFC 1345 does not assume that
          character is present on the keyboard.)
     -
          Macron.  (A horizontal bar over the base character.)
     (
          Breve.  (A shallow dish shape over the base character.)
     .
          Dot above the base character, or in the case of i no dot, or
          in the case of L and l a centered dot.
     :
          Diaeresis (Umlaut).
     c
          Cedilla.
     _
          Underline, however there are currently no underlined
          characters.
     /
          Stroke through the base character.
     "
          Double acute (only supported on a few letters).
     ;
          Ogonek.  (A little forward facing hook at the bottom right of
          the character.)
     <
          Caron.  (A little v over the letter.)
     0
          Circle over the base character.
     2
          Hook over the base character.
     9
          Horn over the base character.

     The most common characters from the Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek and
     Hebrew alphabets are available; consult RFC 1345 for the
     appropriate sequences.  In addition, a set of two letter codes not
     in RFC 1345 are available for the double-width characters
     corresponding to ASCII characters from ! to ~ (0x21 to 0x7e) by
     preceding the character with ^, for example ^A for a double-width
     A.

     The following other two-character sequences are understood.

     ASCII characters
          These are already present on most keyboards:
          <(
               Left square bracket
          //
               Backslash (solidus)
          )>
               Right square bracket
          (!
               Left brace (curly bracket)
          !!
               Vertical bar (pipe symbol)
          !)
               Right brace (curly bracket)
          '?
               Tilde

     Special letters
          Characters found in various variants of the Latin alphabet:
          ss
               Eszett (scharfes S)
          D-, d-
               Eth

insert-files
     This function allows you type a file pattern, and see the results
     of the expansion at each step.  When you hit return, all expansions
     are inserted into the command line.

          bindkey '^Xf' insert-files

insert-unicode-char
     When first executed, the user inputs a set of hexadecimal digits.
     This is terminated with another call to insert-unicode-char.  The
     digits are then turned into the corresponding Unicode character.
     For example, if the widget is bound to ^XU, the character sequence
     '^XU 4 c ^XU' inserts L (Unicode U+004c).

     See insert-composed-char for a way of inserting characters using a
     two-character mnemonic.

narrow-to-region [ -p PRE ] [ -P POST ]
                 [ -S STATEPM | -R STATEPM | [ -l LBUFVAR ] [ -r RBUFVAR ] ]
                 [ -n ] [ START END ]
narrow-to-region-invisible
     Narrow the editable portion of the buffer to the region between the
     cursor and the mark, which may be in either order.  The region may
     not be empty.

     narrow-to-region may be used as a widget or called as a function
     from a user-defined widget; by default, the text outside the
     editable area remains visible.  A recursive-edit is performed and
     the original widening status is then restored.  Various options and
     arguments are available when it is called as a function.

     The options -p PRETEXT and -P POSTTEXT may be used to replace the
     text before and after the display for the duration of the function;
     either or both may be an empty string.

     If the option -n is also given, PRETEXT or POSTTEXT will only be
     inserted if there is text before or after the region respectively
     which will be made invisible.

     Two numeric arguments may be given which will be used instead of
     the cursor and mark positions.

     The option -S STATEPM is used to narrow according to the other
     options while saving the original state in the parameter with name
     STATEPM, while the option -R STATEPM is used to restore the state
     from the parameter; note in both cases the _name_ of the parameter
     is required.  In the second case, other options and arguments are
     irrelevant.  When this method is used, no recursive-edit is
     performed; the calling widget should call this function with the
     option -S, perform its own editing on the command line or pass
     control to the user via 'zle recursive-edit', then call this
     function with the option -R.  The argument STATEPM must be a
     suitable name for an ordinary parameter, except that parameters
     beginning with the prefix _ntr_ are reserved for use within
     narrow-to-region.  Typically the parameter will be local to the
     calling function.

     The options -l LBUFVAR and -r RBUFVAR may be used to specify
     parameters where the widget will store the resulting text from the
     operation.  The parameter LBUFVAR will contain LBUFFER and RBUFVAR
     will contain RBUFFER.  Neither of these two options may be used
     with -S or -R.

     narrow-to-region-invisible is a simple widget which calls
     narrow-to-region with arguments which replace any text outside the
     region with '...'.  It does not take any arguments.

     The display is restored (and the widget returns) upon any zle
     command which would usually cause the line to be accepted or
     aborted.  Hence an additional such command is required to accept or
     abort the current line.

     The return status of both widgets is zero if the line was accepted,
     else non-zero.

     Here is a trivial example of a widget using this feature.
          local state
          narrow-to-region -p $'Editing restricted region\n' \
            -P '' -S state
          zle recursive-edit
          narrow-to-region -R state

predict-on
     This set of functions implements predictive typing using history
     search.  After predict-on, typing characters causes the editor to
     look backward in the history for the first line beginning with what
     you have typed so far.  After predict-off, editing returns to
     normal for the line found.  In fact, you often don't even need to
     use predict-off, because if the line doesn't match something in the
     history, adding a key performs standard completion, and then
     inserts itself if no completions were found.  However, editing in
     the middle of a line is liable to confuse prediction; see the
     toggle style below.

     With the function based completion system (which is needed for
     this), you should be able to type TAB at almost any point to
     advance the cursor to the next ''interesting'' character position
     (usually the end of the current word, but sometimes somewhere in
     the middle of the word).  And of course as soon as the entire line
     is what you want, you can accept with return, without needing to
     move the cursor to the end first.

     The first time predict-on is used, it creates several additional
     widget functions:

     delete-backward-and-predict
          Replaces the backward-delete-char widget.  You do not need to
          bind this yourself.
     insert-and-predict
          Implements predictive typing by replacing the self-insert
          widget.  You do not need to bind this yourself.
     predict-off
          Turns off predictive typing.

     Although you autoload only the predict-on function, it is necessary
     to create a keybinding for predict-off as well.

          zle -N predict-on
          zle -N predict-off
          bindkey '^X^Z' predict-on
          bindkey '^Z' predict-off

read-from-minibuffer
     This is most useful when called as a function from inside a widget,
     but will work correctly as a widget in its own right.  It prompts
     for a value below the current command line; a value may be input
     using all of the standard zle operations (and not merely the
     restricted set available when executing, for example,
     execute-named-cmd).  The value is then returned to the calling
     function in the parameter $REPLY and the editing buffer restored to
     its previous state.  If the read was aborted by a keyboard break
     (typically ^G), the function returns status 1 and $REPLY is not
     set.

     If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a
     prompt, otherwise '? ' is used.  If two arguments are supplied,
     they are the prompt and the initial value of $LBUFFER, and if a
     third argument is given it is the initial value of $RBUFFER.  This
     provides a default value and starting cursor placement.  Upon
     return the entire buffer is the value of $REPLY.

     One option is available: '-k NUM' specifies that NUM characters are
     to be read instead of a whole line.  The line editor is not invoked
     recursively in this case, so depending on the terminal settings the
     input may not be visible, and only the input keys are placed in
     $REPLY, not the entire buffer.  Note that unlike the read builtin
     NUM must be given; there is no default.

     The name is a slight misnomer, as in fact the shell's own
     minibuffer is not used.  Hence it is still possible to call
     executed-named-cmd and similar functions while reading a value.

replace-argument, replace-argument-edit
     The function replace-argument can be used to replace a command line
     argument in the current command line or, if the current command
     line is empty, in the last command line executed (the new command
     line is not executed).  Arguments are as delimited by standard
     shell syntax,

     If a numeric argument is given, that specifies the argument to be
     replaced.  0 means the command name, as in history expansion.  A
     negative numeric argument counts backward from the last word.

     If no numeric argument is given, the current argument is replaced;
     this is the last argument if the previous history line is being
     used.

     The function prompts for a replacement argument.

     If the widget contains the string edit, for example is defined as

          zle -N replace-argument-edit replace-argument

     then the function presents the current value of the argument for
     editing, otherwise the editing buffer for the replacement is
     initially empty.

replace-string, replace-pattern
replace-string-again, replace-pattern-again
     The function replace-string implements three widgets.  If defined
     under the same name as the function, it prompts for two strings;
     the first (source) string will be replaced by the second everywhere
     it occurs in the line editing buffer.

     If the widget name contains the word 'pattern', for example by
     defining the widget using the command 'zle -N replace-pattern
     replace-string', then the matching is performed using zsh patterns.
     All zsh extended globbing patterns can be used in the source
     string; note that unlike filename generation the pattern does not
     need to match an entire word, nor do glob qualifiers have any
     effect.  In addition, the replacement string can contain parameter
     or command substitutions.  Furthermore, a '&' in the replacement
     string will be replaced with the matched source string, and a
     backquoted digit '\N' will be replaced by the Nth parenthesised
     expression matched.  The form '\{N}' may be used to protect the
     digit from following digits.

     If the widget instead contains the word 'regex' (or 'regexp'), then
     the matching is performed using regular expressions, respecting the
     setting of the option RE_MATCH_PCRE (see the description of the
     function regexp-replace below).  The special replacement facilities
     described above for pattern matching are available.

     By default the previous source or replacement string will not be
     offered for editing.  However, this feature can be activated by
     setting the style edit-previous in the context :zle:WIDGET (for
     example, :zle:replace-string) to true.  In addition, a positive
     numeric argument forces the previous values to be offered, a
     negative or zero argument forces them not to be.

     The function replace-string-again can be used to repeat the
     previous replacement; no prompting is done.  As with
     replace-string, if the name of the widget contains the word
     'pattern' or 'regex', pattern or regular expression matching is
     performed, else a literal string replacement.  Note that the
     previous source and replacement text are the same whether pattern,
     regular expression or string matching is used.

     In addition, replace-string shows the previous replacement above
     the prompt, so long as there was one during the current session; if
     the source string is empty, that replacement will be repeated
     without the widget prompting for a replacement string.

     For example, starting from the line:

          print This line contains fan and fond

     and invoking replace-pattern with the source string 'f(?)n' and the
     replacement string 'c\1r' produces the not very useful line:

          print This line contains car and cord

     The range of the replacement string can be limited by using the
     narrow-to-region-invisible widget.  One limitation of the current
     version is that undo will cycle through changes to the replacement
     and source strings before undoing the replacement itself.

send-invisible
     This is similar to read-from-minibuffer in that it may be called as
     a function from a widget or as a widget of its own, and
     interactively reads input from the keyboard.  However, the input
     being typed is concealed and a string of asterisks ('*') is shown
     instead.  The value is saved in the parameter $INVISIBLE to which a
     reference is inserted into the editing buffer at the restored
     cursor position.  If the read was aborted by a keyboard break
     (typically ^G) or another escape from editing such as push-line,
     $INVISIBLE is set to empty and the original buffer is restored
     unchanged.

     If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a
     prompt, otherwise 'Non-echoed text: ' is used (as in emacs).  If a
     second and third argument are supplied they are used to begin and
     end the reference to $INVISIBLE that is inserted into the buffer.
     The default is to open with ${, then INVISIBLE, and close with },
     but many other effects are possible.

smart-insert-last-word
     This function may replace the insert-last-word widget, like so:

          zle -N insert-last-word smart-insert-last-word

     With a numeric argument, or when passed command line arguments in a
     call from another widget, it behaves like insert-last-word, except
     that words in comments are ignored when INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS is
     set.

     Otherwise, the rightmost ''interesting'' word from the previous
     command is found and inserted.  The default definition of
     ''interesting'' is that the word contains at least one alphabetic
     character, slash, or backslash.  This definition may be overridden
     by use of the match style.  The context used to look up the style
     is the widget name, so usually the context is :insert-last-word.
     However, you can bind this function to different widgets to use
     different patterns:

          zle -N insert-last-assignment smart-insert-last-word
          zstyle :insert-last-assignment match '[[:alpha:]][][[:alnum:]]#=*'
          bindkey '\e=' insert-last-assignment

     If no interesting word is found and the auto-previous style is set
     to a true value, the search continues upward through the history.
     When auto-previous is unset or false (the default), the widget must
     be invoked repeatedly in order to search earlier history lines.

transpose-lines
     Only useful with a multi-line editing buffer; the lines here are
     lines within the current on-screen buffer, not history lines.  The
     effect is similar to the function of the same name in Emacs.

     Transpose the current line with the previous line and move the
     cursor to the start of the next line.  Repeating this (which can be
     done by providing a positive numeric argument) has the effect of
     moving the line above the cursor down by a number of lines.

     With a negative numeric argument, requires two lines above the
     cursor.  These two lines are transposed and the cursor moved to the
     start of the previous line.  Using a numeric argument less than -1
     has the effect of moving the line above the cursor up by minus that
     number of lines.

which-command
     This function is a drop-in replacement for the builtin widget
     which-command.  It has enhanced behaviour, in that it correctly
     detects whether or not the command word needs to be expanded as an
     alias; if so, it continues tracing the command word from the
     expanded alias until it reaches the command that will be executed.

     The style whence is available in the context :zle:$WIDGET; this may
     be set to an array to give the command and options that will be
     used to investigate the command word found.  The default is whence
     -c.

zcalc-auto-insert
     This function is useful together with the zcalc function described
     in *note Mathematical Functions::.  It should be bound to a key
     representing a binary operator such as '+', '-', '*' or '/'.  When
     running in zcalc, if the key occurs at the start of the line or
     immediately following an open parenthesis, the text "ans " is
     inserted before the representation of the key itself.  This allows
     easy use of the answer from the previous calculation in the current
     line.  The text to be inserted before the symbol typed can be
     modified by setting the variable ZCALC_AUTO_INSERT_PREFIX.

     Hence, for example, typing '+12' followed by return adds 12 to the
     previous result.

     When not in zcalc, the key simply inserts the symbol itself.

26.6.2 Utility Functions
------------------------

These functions are useful in constructing widgets.  They should be
loaded with 'autoload -U FUNCTION' and called as indicated from
user-defined widgets.

split-shell-arguments
     This function splits the line currently being edited into shell
     arguments and whitespace.  The result is stored in the array reply.
     The array contains all the parts of the line in order, starting
     with any whitespace before the first argument, and finishing with
     any whitespace after the last argument.  Hence (so long as the
     option KSH_ARRAYS is not set) whitespace is given by odd indices in
     the array and arguments by even indices.  Note that no stripping of
     quotes is done; joining together all the elements of reply in order
     is guaranteed to produce the original line.

     The parameter REPLY is set to the index of the word in reply which
     contains the character after the cursor, where the first element
     has index 1.  The parameter REPLY2 is set to the index of the
     character under the cursor in that word, where the first character
     has index 1.

     Hence reply, REPLY and REPLY2 should all be made local to the
     enclosing function.

     See the function modify-current-argument, described below, for an
     example of how to call this function.

modify-current-argument [ EXPR-USING-$ARG | FUNC ]
     This function provides a simple method of allowing user-defined
     widgets to modify the command line argument under the cursor (or
     immediately to the left of the cursor if the cursor is between
     arguments).

     The argument can be an expression which when evaluated operates on
     the shell parameter ARG, which will have been set to the command
     line argument under the cursor.  The expression should be suitably
     quoted to prevent it being evaluated too early.

     Alternatively, if the argument does not contain the string ARG, it
     is assumed to be a shell function, to which the current command
     line argument is passed as the only argument.  The function should
     set the variable REPLY to the new value for the command line
     argument.  If the function returns non-zero status, so does the
     calling function.

     For example, a user-defined widget containing the following code
     converts the characters in the argument under the cursor into all
     upper case:

          modify-current-argument '${(U)ARG}'

     The following strips any quoting from the current word (whether
     backslashes or one of the styles of quotes), and replaces it with
     single quoting throughout:

          modify-current-argument '${(qq)${(Q)ARG}}'

     The following performs directory expansion on the command line
     argument and replaces it by the absolute path:

          expand-dir() {
            REPLY=${~1}
            REPLY=${REPLY:a}
          }
          modify-current-argument expand-dir

     In practice the function expand-dir would probably not be defined
     within the widget where modify-current-argument is called.

26.6.3 Styles
-------------

The behavior of several of the above widgets can be controlled by the
use of the zstyle mechanism.  In particular, widgets that interact with
the completion system pass along their context to any completions that
they invoke.

break-keys
     This style is used by the incremental-complete-word widget.  Its
     value should be a pattern, and all keys matching this pattern will
     cause the widget to stop incremental completion without the key
     having any further effect.  Like all styles used directly by
     incremental-complete-word, this style is looked up using the
     context ':incremental'.

completer
     The incremental-complete-word and insert-and-predict widgets set up
     their top-level context name before calling completion.  This
     allows one to define different sets of completer functions for
     normal completion and for these widgets.  For example, to use
     completion, approximation and correction for normal completion,
     completion and correction for incremental completion and only
     completion for prediction one could use:

          zstyle ':completion:*' completer \
                  _complete _correct _approximate
          zstyle ':completion:incremental:*' completer \
                  _complete _correct
          zstyle ':completion:predict:*' completer \
                  _complete

     It is a good idea to restrict the completers used in prediction,
     because they may be automatically invoked as you type.  The _list
     and _menu completers should never be used with prediction.  The
     _approximate, _correct, _expand, and _match completers may be used,
     but be aware that they may change characters anywhere in the word
     behind the cursor, so you need to watch carefully that the result
     is what you intended.

cursor
     The insert-and-predict widget uses this style, in the context
     ':predict', to decide where to place the cursor after completion
     has been tried.  Values are:

     complete
          The cursor is left where it was when completion finished, but
          only if it is after a character equal to the one just inserted
          by the user.  If it is after another character, this value is
          the same as 'key'.

     key
          The cursor is left after the Nth occurrence of the character
          just inserted, where N is the number of times that character
          appeared in the word before completion was attempted.  In
          short, this has the effect of leaving the cursor after the
          character just typed even if the completion code found out
          that no other characters need to be inserted at that position.

     Any other value for this style unconditionally leaves the cursor at
     the position where the completion code left it.

list
     When using the incremental-complete-word widget, this style says if
     the matches should be listed on every key press (if they fit on the
     screen).  Use the context prefix ':completion:incremental'.

     The insert-and-predict widget uses this style to decide if the
     completion should be shown even if there is only one possible
     completion.  This is done if the value of this style is the string
     always.  In this case the context is ':predict' (_not_
     ':completion:predict').

match
     This style is used by smart-insert-last-word to provide a pattern
     (using full EXTENDED_GLOB syntax) that matches an interesting word.
     The context is the name of the widget to which
     smart-insert-last-word is bound (see above).  The default behavior
     of smart-insert-last-word is equivalent to:

          zstyle :insert-last-word match '*[[:alpha:]/\\]*'

     However, you might want to include words that contain spaces:

          zstyle :insert-last-word match '*[[:alpha:][:space:]/\\]*'

     Or include numbers as long as the word is at least two characters
     long:

          zstyle :insert-last-word match '*([[:digit:]]?|[[:alpha:]/\\])*'

     The above example causes redirections like "2>" to be included.

prompt
     The incremental-complete-word widget shows the value of this style
     in the status line during incremental completion.  The string value
     may contain any of the following substrings in the manner of the
     PS1 and other prompt parameters:

     %c
          Replaced by the name of the completer function that generated
          the matches (without the leading underscore).

     %l
          When the list style is set, replaced by '...' if the list of
          matches is too long to fit on the screen and with an empty
          string otherwise.  If the list style is 'false' or not set,
          '%l' is always removed.

     %n
          Replaced by the number of matches generated.

     %s
          Replaced by '-no match-', '-no prefix-', or an empty string if
          there is no completion matching the word on the line, if the
          matches have no common prefix different from the word on the
          line, or if there is such a common prefix, respectively.

     %u
          Replaced by the unambiguous part of all matches, if there is
          any, and if it is different from the word on the line.

     Like 'break-keys', this uses the ':incremental' context.

stop-keys
     This style is used by the incremental-complete-word widget.  Its
     value is treated similarly to the one for the break-keys style (and
     uses the same context: ':incremental').  However, in this case all
     keys matching the pattern given as its value will stop incremental
     completion and will then execute their usual function.

toggle
     This boolean style is used by predict-on and its related widgets in
     the context ':predict'.  If set to one of the standard 'true'
     values, predictive typing is automatically toggled off in
     situations where it is unlikely to be useful, such as when editing
     a multi-line buffer or after moving into the middle of a line and
     then deleting a character.  The default is to leave prediction
     turned on until an explicit call to predict-off.

verbose
     This boolean style is used by predict-on and its related widgets in
     the context ':predict'.  If set to one of the standard 'true'
     values, these widgets display a message below the prompt when the
     predictive state is toggled.  This is most useful in combination
     with the toggle style.  The default does not display these
     messages.

widget
     This style is similar to the command style: For widget functions
     that use zle to call other widgets, this style can sometimes be
     used to override the widget which is called.  The context for this
     style is the name of the calling widget (_not_ the name of the
     calling function, because one function may be bound to multiple
     widget names).

          zstyle :copy-earlier-word widget smart-insert-last-word

     Check the documentation for the calling widget or function to
     determine whether the widget style is used.

26.7 Exception Handling
=======================

Two functions are provided to enable zsh to provide exception handling
in a form that should be familiar from other languages.

throw EXCEPTION
     The function throw throws the named EXCEPTION.  The name is an
     arbitrary string and is only used by the throw and catch functions.
     An exception is for the most part treated the same as a shell
     error, i.e.  an unhandled exception will cause the shell to abort
     all processing in a function or script and to return to the top
     level in an interactive shell.

catch EXCEPTION-PATTERN
     The function catch returns status zero if an exception was thrown
     and the pattern EXCEPTION-PATTERN matches its name.  Otherwise it
     returns status 1.  EXCEPTION-PATTERN is a standard shell pattern,
     respecting the current setting of the EXTENDED_GLOB option.  An
     alias catch is also defined to prevent the argument to the function
     from matching filenames, so patterns may be used unquoted.  Note
     that as exceptions are not fundamentally different from other shell
     errors it is possible to catch shell errors by using an empty
     string as the exception name.  The shell variable CAUGHT is set by
     catch to the name of the exception caught.  It is possible to
     rethrow an exception by calling the throw function again once an
     exception has been caught.

The functions are designed to be used together with the always construct
described in *note Complex Commands::.  This is important as only this
construct provides the required support for exceptions.  A typical
example is as follows.

     {
       # "try" block
       # ... nested code here calls "throw MyExcept"
     } always {
       # "always" block
       if catch MyExcept; then
         print "Caught exception MyExcept"
       elif catch ''; then
         print "Caught a shell error.  Propagating..."
         throw ''
       fi
       # Other exceptions are not handled but may be caught further
       # up the call stack.
     }

If all exceptions should be caught, the following idiom might be
preferable.

     {
       # ... nested code here throws an exception
     } always {
       if catch *; then
         case $CAUGHT in
           (MyExcept)
           print "Caught my own exception"
           ;;
           (*)
           print "Caught some other exception"
           ;;
         esac
       fi
     }

In common with exception handling in other languages, the exception may
be thrown by code deeply nested inside the 'try' block.  However, note
that it must be thrown inside the current shell, not in a subshell
forked for a pipeline, parenthesised current-shell construct, or some
form of command or process substitution.

The system internally uses the shell variable EXCEPTION to record the
name of the exception between throwing and catching.  One drawback of
this scheme is that if the exception is not handled the variable
EXCEPTION remains set and may be incorrectly recognised as the name of
an exception if a shell error subsequently occurs.  Adding unset
EXCEPTION at the start of the outermost layer of any code that uses
exception handling will eliminate this problem.


File: zsh.info,  Node: MIME Functions,  Next: Mathematical Functions,  Prev: Exception Handling,  Up: User Contributions

26.8 MIME Functions
===================

Three functions are available to provide handling of files recognised by
extension, for example to dispatch a file text.ps when executed as a
command to an appropriate viewer.

zsh-mime-setup [ -fv ] [ -l [ SUFFIX ... ] ]
zsh-mime-handler [ -l ] COMMAND ARGUMENT ...
     These two functions use the files ~/.mime.types and
     /etc/mime.types, which associate types and extensions, as well as
     ~/.mailcap and /etc/mailcap files, which associate types and the
     programs that handle them.  These are provided on many systems with
     the Multimedia Internet Mail Extensions.

     To enable the system, the function zsh-mime-setup should be
     autoloaded and run.  This allows files with extensions to be
     treated as executable; such files be completed by the function
     completion system.  The function zsh-mime-handler should not need
     to be called by the user.

     The system works by setting up suffix aliases with 'alias -s'.
     Suffix aliases already installed by the user will not be
     overwritten.

     For suffixes defined in lower case, upper case variants will also
     automatically be handled (e.g.  PDF is automatically handled if
     handling for the suffix pdf is defined), but not vice versa.

     Repeated calls to zsh-mime-setup do not override the existing
     mapping between suffixes and executable files unless the option -f
     is given.  Note, however, that this does not override existing
     suffix aliases assigned to handlers other than zsh-mime-handler.

     Calling zsh-mime-setup with the option -l lists the existing
     mappings without altering them.  Suffixes to list (which may
     contain pattern characters that should be quoted from immediate
     interpretation on the command line) may be given as additional
     arguments, otherwise all suffixes are listed.

     Calling zsh-mime-setup with the option -v causes verbose output to
     be shown during the setup operation.

     The system respects the mailcap flags needsterminal and
     copiousoutput, see man page mailcap(4).

     The functions use the following styles, which are defined with the
     zstyle builtin command (*note The zsh/zutil Module::).  They should
     be defined before zsh-mime-setup is run.  The contexts used all
     start with :mime:, with additional components in some cases.  It is
     recommended that a trailing * (suitably quoted) be appended to
     style patterns in case the system is extended in future.  Some
     examples are given below.

     For files that have multiple suffixes, e.g.  .pdf.gz, where the
     context includes the suffix it will be looked up starting with the
     longest possible suffix until a match for the style is found.  For
     example, if .pdf.gz produces a match for the handler, that will be
     used; otherwise the handler for .gz will be used.  Note that, owing
     to the way suffix aliases work, it is always required that there be
     a handler for the shortest possible suffix, so in this example
     .pdf.gz can only be handled if .gz is also handled (though not
     necessarily in the same way).  Alternatively, if no handling for
     .gz on its own is needed, simply adding the command

          alias -s gz=zsh-mime-handler

     to the initialisation code is sufficient; .gz will not be handled
     on its own, but may be in combination with other suffixes.

     current-shell
          If this boolean style is true, the mailcap handler for the
          context in question is run using the eval builtin instead of
          by starting a new sh process.  This is more efficient, but may
          not work in the occasional cases where the mailcap handler
          uses strict POSIX syntax.

     disown
          If this boolean style is true, mailcap handlers started in the
          background will be disowned, i.e.  not subject to job control
          within the parent shell.  Such handlers nearly always produce
          their own windows, so the only likely harmful side effect of
          setting the style is that it becomes harder to kill jobs from
          within the shell.

     execute-as-is
          This style gives a list of patterns to be matched against
          files passed for execution with a handler program.  If the
          file matches the pattern, the entire command line is executed
          in its current form, with no handler.  This is useful for
          files which might have suffixes but nonetheless be executable
          in their own right.  If the style is not set, the pattern *(*)
          *(/) is used; hence executable files are executed directly and
          not passed to a handler, and the option AUTO_CD may be used to
          change to directories that happen to have MIME suffixes.

     execute-never
          This style is useful in combination with execute-as-is.  It is
          set to an array of patterns corresponding to full paths to
          files that should never be treated as executable, even if the
          file passed to the MIME handler matches execute-as-is.  This
          is useful for file systems that don't handle execute
          permission or that contain executables from another operating
          system.  For example, if /mnt/windows is a Windows mount, then

               zstyle ':mime:*' execute-never '/mnt/windows/*'

          will ensure that any files found in that area will be executed
          as MIME types even if they are executable.  As this example
          shows, the complete file name is matched against the pattern,
          regardless of how the file was passed to the handler.  The
          file is resolved to a full path using the :A modifier
          described in *note Modifiers::; this means that symbolic links
          are resolved where possible, so that links into other file
          systems behave in the correct fashion.

     file-path
          Used if the style find-file-in-path is true for the same
          context.  Set to an array of directories that are used for
          searching for the file to be handled; the default is the
          command path given by the special parameter path.  The shell
          option PATH_DIRS is respected; if that is set, the appropriate
          path will be searched even if the name of the file to be
          handled as it appears on the command line contains a '/'.  The
          full context is :mime:.SUFFIX:, as described for the style
          handler.

     find-file-in-path
          If set, allows files whose names do not contain absolute paths
          to be searched for in the command path or the path specified
          by the file-path style.  If the file is not found in the path,
          it is looked for locally (whether or not the current directory
          is in the path); if it is not found locally, the handler will
          abort unless the handle-nonexistent style is set.  Files found
          in the path are tested as described for the style
          execute-as-is.  The full context is :mime:.SUFFIX:, as
          described for the style handler.

     flags
          Defines flags to go with a handler; the context is as for the
          handler style, and the format is as for the flags in mailcap.

     handle-nonexistent
          By default, arguments that don't correspond to files are not
          passed to the MIME handler in order to prevent it from
          intercepting commands found in the path that happen to have
          suffixes.  This style may be set to an array of extended glob
          patterns for arguments that will be passed to the handler even
          if they don't exist.  If it is not explicitly set it defaults
          to [[:alpha:]]#:/* which allows URLs to be passed to the MIME
          handler even though they don't exist in that format in the
          file system.  The full context is :mime:.SUFFIX:, as described
          for the style handler.

     handler
          Specifies a handler for a suffix; the suffix is given by the
          context as :mime:.SUFFIX:, and the format of the handler is
          exactly that in mailcap.  Note in particular the '.' and
          trailing colon to distinguish this use of the context.  This
          overrides any handler specified by the mailcap files.  If the
          handler requires a terminal, the flags style should be set to
          include the word needsterminal, or if the output is to be
          displayed through a pager (but not if the handler is itself a
          pager), it should include copiousoutput.

     mailcap
          A list of files in the format of ~/.mailcap and /etc/mailcap
          to be read during setup, replacing the default list which
          consists of those two files.  The context is :mime:.  A + in
          the list will be replaced by the default files.

     mailcap-priorities
          This style is used to resolve multiple mailcap entries for the
          same MIME type.  It consists of an array of the following
          elements, in descending order of priority; later entries will
          be used if earlier entries are unable to resolve the entries
          being compared.  If none of the tests resolve the entries, the
          first entry encountered is retained.

          files
               The order of files (entries in the mailcap style) read.
               Earlier files are preferred.  (Note this does not resolve
               entries in the same file.)

          priority
               The priority flag from the mailcap entry.  The priority
               is an integer from 0 to 9 with the default value being 5.

          flags
               The test given by the mailcap-prio-flags option is used
               to resolve entries.

          place
               Later entries are preferred; as the entries are strictly
               ordered, this test always succeeds.

          Note that as this style is handled during initialisation, the
          context is always :mime:, with no discrimination by suffix.

     mailcap-prio-flags
          This style is used when the keyword flags is encountered in
          the list of tests specified by the mailcap-priorities style.
          It should be set to a list of patterns, each of which is
          tested against the flags specified in the mailcap entry (in
          other words, the sets of assignments found with some entries
          in the mailcap file).  Earlier patterns in the list are
          preferred to later ones, and matched patterns are preferred to
          unmatched ones.

     mime-types
          A list of files in the format of ~/.mime.types and
          /etc/mime.types to be read during setup, replacing the default
          list which consists of those two files.  The context is
          :mime:.  A + in the list will be replaced by the default
          files.

     never-background
          If this boolean style is set, the handler for the given
          context is always run in the foreground, even if the flags
          provided in the mailcap entry suggest it need not be (for
          example, it doesn't require a terminal).

     pager
          If set, will be used instead of $PAGER or more to handle
          suffixes where the copiousoutput flag is set.  The context is
          as for handler, i.e.  :mime:.SUFFIX: for handling a file with
          the given SUFFIX.

     Examples:

          zstyle ':mime:*' mailcap ~/.mailcap /usr/local/etc/mailcap
          zstyle ':mime:.txt:' handler less %s
          zstyle ':mime:.txt:' flags needsterminal

     When zsh-mime-setup is subsequently run, it will look for mailcap
     entries in the two files given.  Files of suffix .txt will be
     handled by running 'less FILE.TXT'.  The flag needsterminal is set
     to show that this program must run attached to a terminal.

     As there are several steps to dispatching a command, the following
     should be checked if attempting to execute a file by extension .EXT
     does not have the expected effect.

     The command 'alias -s EXT' should show 'ps=zsh-mime-handler'.  If
     it shows something else, another suffix alias was already installed
     and was not overwritten.  If it shows nothing, no handler was
     installed: this is most likely because no handler was found in the
     .mime.types and mailcap combination for .ext files.  In that case,
     appropriate handling should be added to ~/.mime.types and mailcap.

     If the extension is handled by zsh-mime-handler but the file is not
     opened correctly, either the handler defined for the type is
     incorrect, or the flags associated with it are in appropriate.
     Running zsh-mime-setup -l will show the handler and, if there are
     any, the flags.  A %s in the handler is replaced by the file
     (suitably quoted if necessary).  Check that the handler program
     listed lists and can be run in the way shown.  Also check that the
     flags needsterminal or copiousoutput are set if the handler needs
     to be run under a terminal; the second flag is used if the output
     should be sent to a pager.  An example of a suitable mailcap entry
     for such a program is:

          text/html; /usr/bin/lynx '%s'; needsterminal

     Running 'zsh-mime-handler -l COMMAND LINE' prints the command line
     that would be executed, simplified to remove the effect of any
     flags, and quoted so that the output can be run as a complete zsh
     command line.  This is used by the completion system to decide how
     to complete after a file handled by zsh-mime-setup.

pick-web-browser
     This function is separate from the two MIME functions described
     above and can be assigned directly to a suffix:

          autoload -U pick-web-browser
          alias -s html=pick-web-browser

     It is provided as an intelligent front end to dispatch a web
     browser.  It may be run as either a function or a shell script.
     The status 255 is returned if no browser could be started.

     Various styles are available to customize the choice of browsers:

     browser-style
          The value of the style is an array giving preferences in
          decreasing order for the type of browser to use.  The values
          of elements may be

          running
               Use a GUI browser that is already running when an X
               Window display is available.  The browsers listed in the
               x-browsers style are tried in order until one is found;
               if it is, the file will be displayed in that browser, so
               the user may need to check whether it has appeared.  If
               no running browser is found, one is not started.
               Browsers other than Firefox, Opera and Konqueror are
               assumed to understand the Mozilla syntax for opening a
               URL remotely.

          x
               Start a new GUI browser when an X Window display is
               available.  Search for the availability of one of the
               browsers listed in the x-browsers style and start the
               first one that is found.  No check is made for an already
               running browser.

          tty
               Start a terminal-based browser.  Search for the
               availability of one of the browsers listed in the
               tty-browsers style and start the first one that is found.

          If the style is not set the default running x tty is used.

     x-browsers
          An array in decreasing order of preference of browsers to use
          when running under the X Window System.  The array consists of
          the command name under which to start the browser.  They are
          looked up in the context :mime: (which may be extended in
          future, so appending '*' is recommended).  For example,

               zstyle ':mime:*' x-browsers opera konqueror firefox

          specifies that pick-web-browser should first look for a
          running instance of Opera, Konqueror or Firefox, in that
          order, and if it fails to find any should attempt to start
          Opera.  The default is firefox mozilla netscape opera
          konqueror.

     tty-browsers
          An array similar to x-browsers, except that it gives browsers
          to use when no X Window display is available.  The default is
          elinks links lynx.

     command
          If it is set this style is used to pick the command used to
          open a page for a browser.  The context is
          :mime:browser:new:$browser: to start a new browser or
          :mime:browser:running:$browser: to open a URL in a browser
          already running on the current X display, where $browser is
          the value matched in the x-browsers or tty-browsers style.
          The escape sequence %b in the style's value will be replaced
          by the browser, while %u will be replaced by the URL. If the
          style is not set, the default for all new instances is
          equivalent to %b %u and the defaults for using running
          browsers are equivalent to the values kfmclient openURL %u for
          Konqueror, firefox -new-tab %u for Firefox, opera -newpage %u
          for Opera, and %b -remote "openUrl(%u)" for all others.

26.9 Mathematical Functions
===========================

zcalc [ -ef ] [ EXPRESSION ... ]
     A reasonably powerful calculator based on zsh's arithmetic
     evaluation facility.  The syntax is similar to that of formulae in
     most programming languages; see *note Arithmetic Evaluation:: for
     details.

     Non-programmers should note that, as in many other programming
     languages, expressions involving only integers (whether constants
     without a '.', variables containing such constants as strings, or
     variables declared to be integers) are by default evaluated using
     integer arithmetic, which is not how an ordinary desk calculator
     operates.  To force floating point operation, pass the option -f;
     see further notes below.

     The mathematical library zsh/mathfunc will be loaded if it is
     available; see *note The zsh/mathfunc Module::.  The mathematical
     functions correspond to the raw system libraries, so trigonometric
     functions are evaluated using radians, and so on.

     Each line typed is evaluated as an expression.  The prompt shows a
     number, which corresponds to a positional parameter where the
     result of that calculation is stored.  For example, the result of
     the calculation on the line preceded by '4> ' is available as $4.
     The last value calculated is available as ans.  Full command line
     editing, including the history of previous calculations, is
     available; the history is saved in the file ~/.zcalc_history.  To
     exit, enter a blank line or type ':q' on its own ('q' is allowed
     for historical compatibility).

     A line ending with a single backslash is treated in the same
     fashion as it is in command line editing: the backslash is removed,
     the function prompts for more input (the prompt is preceded by
     '...' to indicate this), and the lines are combined into one to get
     the final result.  In addition, if the input so far contains more
     open than close parentheses zcalc will prompt for more input.

     If arguments are given to zcalc on start up, they are used to prime
     the first few positional parameters.  A visual indication of this
     is given when the calculator starts.

     The constants PI (3.14159...)  and E (2.71828...)  are provided.
     Parameter assignment is possible, but note that all parameters will
     be put into the global namespace.

     The output base can be initialised by passing the option '-#BASE',
     for example 'zcalc -#16' (the '#' may have to be quoted, depending
     on the globbing options set).

     If the option '-e' is set, the function runs non-interactively: the
     arguments are treated as expressions to be evaluated as if entered
     interactively line by line.

     If the option '-f' is set, all numbers are treated as floating
     point, hence for example the expression '3/4' evaluates to 0.75
     rather than 0.  Options must appear in separate words.

     The prompt is configurable via the parameter ZCALCPROMPT, which
     undergoes standard prompt expansion.  The index of the current
     entry is stored locally in the first element of the array psvar,
     which can be referred to in ZCALCPROMPT as '%1v'.  The default
     prompt is '%1v> '.

     A few special commands are available; these are introduced by a
     colon.  For backward compatibility, the colon may be omitted for
     certain commands.  Completion is available if compinit has been
     run.

     The output precision may be specified within zcalc by special
     commands familiar from many calculators.
     :norm
          The default output format.  It corresponds to the printf %g
          specification.  Typically this shows six decimal digits.

     :sci DIGITS
          Scientific notation, corresponding to the printf %g output
          format with the precision given by DIGITS.  This produces
          either fixed point or exponential notation depending on the
          value output.

     :fix DIGITS
          Fixed point notation, corresponding to the printf %f output
          format with the precision given by DIGITS.

     :eng DIGITS
          Exponential notation, corresponding to the printf %E output
          format with the precision given by DIGITS.

     :raw
          Raw output: this is the default form of the output from a math
          evaluation.  This may show more precision than the number
          actually possesses.

     Other special commands:
     :!LINE...
          Execute LINE... as a normal shell command line.  Note that it
          is executed in the context of the function, i.e.  with local
          variables.  Space is optional after :!.

     :local ARG ...
          Declare variables local to the function.  Note that certain
          variables are used by the function for its own purposes.
          Other variables may be used, too, but they will be taken from
          or put into the global scope.

     :function NAME [ BODY ]
          Define a mathematical function or (with no BODY) delete it.
          :function may be abbreviated to :func or simply :f.  The NAME
          may contain the same characters as a shell function name.  The
          function is defined using zmathfuncdef, see below.

          Note that zcalc takes care of all quoting.  Hence for example:

               :f cube $1 * $1 * $1

          defines a function to cube the sole argument.

     [#BASE]
          This is not a special command, rather part of normal
          arithmetic syntax; however, when this form appears on a line
          by itself the default output radix is set to BASE.  Use, for
          example, '[#16]' to display hexadecimal output preceded by an
          indication of the base, or '[##16]' just to display the raw
          number in the given base.  Bases themselves are always
          specified in decimal.  '[#]' restores the normal output
          format.  Note that setting an output base suppresses floating
          point output; use '[#]' to return to normal operation.

     See the comments in the function for a few extra tips.

zmathfuncdef [ MATHFUNC [ BODY ] ]
     A convenient front end to functions -M.

     With two arguments, define a mathematical function named MATHFUNC
     which can be used in any form of arithmetic evaluation.  BODY is a
     mathematical expression to implement the function.  It may contain
     references to position parameters $1, $2, ...  to refer to
     mandatory parameters and ${1:-DEFVALUE} ...  to refer to optional
     parameters.  Note that the forms must be strictly adhered to for
     the function to calculate the correct number of arguments.  The
     implementation is held in a shell function named
     zsh_math_func_MATHFUNC; usually the user will not need to refer to
     the shell function directly.  Any existing function of the same
     name is silently replaced.

     With one argument, remove the mathematical function MATHFUNC as
     well as the shell function implementation.

     With no arguments, list all MATHFUNC functions in a form suitable
     for restoring the definition.  The functions have not necessarily
     been defined by zmathfuncdef.

26.10 User Configuration Functions
==================================

The zsh/newuser module comes with a function to aid in configuring shell
options for new users.  If the module is installed, this function can
also be run by hand.  It is available even if the module's default
behaviour, namely running the function for a new user logging in without
startup files, is inhibited.

zsh-newuser-install [ -f ]
     The function presents the user with various options for customizing
     their initialization scripts.  Currently only ~/.zshrc is handled.
     $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc is used instead if the parameter ZDOTDIR is set;
     this provides a way for the user to configure a file without
     altering an existing .zshrc.

     By default the function exits immediately if it finds any of the
     files .zshenv, .zprofile, .zshrc, or .zlogin in the appropriate
     directory.  The option -f is required in order to force the
     function to continue.  Note this may happen even if .zshrc itself
     does not exist.

     As currently configured, the function will exit immediately if the
     user has root privileges; this behaviour cannot be overridden.

     Once activated, the function's behaviour is supposed to be
     self-explanatory.  Menus are present allowing the user to alter the
     value of options and parameters.  Suggestions for improvements are
     always welcome.

     When the script exits, the user is given the opportunity to save
     the new file or not; changes are not irreversible until this point.
     However, the script is careful to restrict changes to the file only
     to a group marked by the lines '# Lines configured by
     zsh-newuser-install' and '# End of lines configured by
     zsh-newuser-install'.  In addition, the old version of .zshrc is
     saved to a file with the suffix .zni appended.

     If the function edits an existing .zshrc, it is up to the user to
     ensure that the changes made will take effect.  For example, if
     control usually returns early from the existing .zshrc the lines
     will not be executed; or a later initialization file may override
     options or parameters, and so on.  The function itself does not
     attempt to detect any such conflicts.

26.11 Other Functions
=====================

There are a large number of helpful functions in the Functions/Misc
directory of the zsh distribution.  Most are very simple and do not
require documentation here, but a few are worthy of special mention.

26.11.1 Descriptions
--------------------

colors
     This function initializes several associative arrays to map color
     names to (and from) the ANSI standard eight-color terminal codes.
     These are used by the prompt theme system (*note Prompt Themes::).
     You seldom should need to run colors more than once.

     The eight base colors are: black, red, green, yellow, blue,
     magenta, cyan, and white.  Each of these has codes for foreground
     and background.  In addition there are seven intensity attributes:
     bold, faint, standout, underline, blink, reverse, and conceal.
     Finally, there are seven codes used to negate attributes: none
     (reset all attributes to the defaults), normal (neither bold nor
     faint), no-standout, no-underline, no-blink, no-reverse, and
     no-conceal.

     Some terminals do not support all combinations of colors and
     intensities.

     The associative arrays are:

     color
     colour
          Map all the color names to their integer codes, and integer
          codes to the color names.  The eight base names map to the
          foreground color codes, as do names prefixed with 'fg-', such
          as 'fg-red'.  Names prefixed with 'bg-', such as 'bg-blue',
          refer to the background codes.  The reverse mapping from code
          to color yields base name for foreground codes and the bg-
          form for backgrounds.

          Although it is a misnomer to call them 'colors', these arrays
          also map the other fourteen attributes from names to codes and
          codes to names.

     fg
     fg_bold
     fg_no_bold
          Map the eight basic color names to ANSI terminal escape
          sequences that set the corresponding foreground text
          properties.  The fg sequences change the color without
          changing the eight intensity attributes.

     bg
     bg_bold
     bg_no_bold
          Map the eight basic color names to ANSI terminal escape
          sequences that set the corresponding background properties.
          The bg sequences change the color without changing the eight
          intensity attributes.

     In addition, the scalar parameters reset_color and bold_color are
     set to the ANSI terminal escapes that turn off all attributes and
     turn on bold intensity, respectively.

fned [ -x NUM ] NAME
     Same as zed -f.  This function does not appear in the zsh
     distribution, but can be created by linking zed to the name fned in
     some directory in your fpath.

is-at-least NEEDED [ PRESENT ]
     Perform a greater-than-or-equal-to comparison of two strings having
     the format of a zsh version number; that is, a string of numbers
     and text with segments separated by dots or dashes.  If the PRESENT
     string is not provided, $ZSH_VERSION is used.  Segments are paired
     left-to-right in the two strings with leading non-number parts
     ignored.  If one string has fewer segments than the other, the
     missing segments are considered zero.

     This is useful in startup files to set options and other state that
     are not available in all versions of zsh.

          is-at-least 3.1.6-15 && setopt NO_GLOBAL_RCS
          is-at-least 3.1.0 && setopt HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS
          is-at-least 2.6-17 || print "You can't use is-at-least here."

nslookup [ ARG ... ]
     This wrapper function for the nslookup command requires the
     zsh/zpty module (see *note The zsh/zpty Module::).  It behaves
     exactly like the standard nslookup except that it provides
     customizable prompts (including a right-side prompt) and completion
     of nslookup commands, host names, etc.  (if you use the
     function-based completion system).  Completion styles may be set
     with the context prefix ':completion:nslookup'.

     See also the pager, prompt and rprompt styles below.

regexp-replace VAR REGEXP REPLACE
     Use regular expressions to perform a global search and replace
     operation on a variable.  If the option RE_MATCH_PCRE is not set,
     POSIX extended regular expressions are used, else Perl-compatible
     regular expressions (this requires the shell to be linked against
     the pcre library).

     VAR is the name of the variable containing the string to be
     matched.  The variable will be modified directly by the function.
     The variables MATCH, MBEGIN, MEND, match, mbegin, mend should be
     avoided as these are used by the regular expression code.

     REGEXP is the regular expression to match against the string.

     REPLACE is the replacement text.  This can contain parameter,
     command and arithmetic expressions which will be replaced: in
     particular, a reference to $MATCH will be replaced by the text
     matched by the pattern.

     The return status is 0 if at least one match was performed, else 1.

run-help CMD
     This function is designed to be invoked by the run-help ZLE widget,
     in place of the default alias.  See 'Accessing On-Line Help' (*note
     Utilities::) for setup instructions.

     In the discussion which follows, if CMD is a file system path, it
     is first reduced to its rightmost component (the file name).

     Help is first sought by looking for a file named CMD in the
     directory named by the HELPDIR parameter.  If no file is found, an
     assistant function, alias, or command named run-help-CMD is sought.
     If found, the assistant is executed with the rest of the current
     command line (everything after the command name CMD) as its
     arguments.  When neither file nor assistant is found, the external
     command 'man CMD' is run.

     An example assistant for the "ssh" command:

          run-help-ssh() {
              emulate -LR zsh
              local -a args
              # Delete the "-l username" option
              zparseopts -D -E -a args l:
              # Delete other options, leaving: host command
              args=(${@:#-*})
              if [[ ${#args} -lt 2 ]]; then
                  man ssh
              else
                  run-help $args[2]
              fi
          }

     Several of these assistants are provided in the Functions/Misc
     directory.  These must be autoloaded, or placed as executable
     scripts in your search path, in order to be found and used by
     run-help.

     run-help-git
     run-help-svk
     run-help-svn
          Assistant functions for the git, svk, and svn commands.

tetris
     Zsh was once accused of not being as complete as Emacs, because it
     lacked a Tetris game.  This function was written to refute this
     vicious slander.

     This function must be used as a ZLE widget:

          autoload -U tetris
          zle -N tetris
          bindkey KEYS tetris

     To start a game, execute the widget by typing the KEYS.  Whatever
     command line you were editing disappears temporarily, and your
     keymap is also temporarily replaced by the Tetris control keys.
     The previous editor state is restored when you quit the game (by
     pressing 'q') or when you lose.

     If you quit in the middle of a game, the next invocation of the
     tetris widget will continue where you left off.  If you lost, it
     will start a new game.

tetriscurses
     This is a port of the above to zcurses.  The input handling is
     improved a bit so that moving a block sideways doesn't
     automatically advance a timestep, and the graphics use unicode
     block graphics.

     This version does not save the game state between invocations, and
     is not invoked as a widget, but rather as:

          autoload -U tetriscurses
          tetriscurses

zargs [ OPTION ... -- ] [ INPUT ... ] [ -- COMMAND [ ARG ... ] ]
     This function has a similar purpose to GNU xargs.  Instead of
     reading lines of arguments from the standard input, it takes them
     from the command line.  This is useful because zsh, especially with
     recursive glob operators, often can construct a command line for a
     shell function that is longer than can be accepted by an external
     command.

     The OPTION list represents options of the zargs command itself,
     which are the same as those of xargs.  The INPUT list is the
     collection of strings (often file names) that become the arguments
     of the command, analogous to the standard input of xargs.  Finally,
     the ARG list consists of those arguments (usually options) that are
     passed to the COMMAND each time it runs.  The ARG list precedes the
     elements from the input list in each run.  If no COMMAND is
     provided, then no ARG list may be provided, and in that event the
     default command is 'print' with arguments '-r --'.

     For example, to get a long ls listing of all plain files in the
     current directory or its subdirectories:

          autoload -U zargs
          zargs -- **/*(.) -- ls -l

     Note that '--' is used both to mark the end of the OPTION list and
     to mark the end of the INPUT list, so it must appear twice whenever
     the INPUT list may be empty.  If there is guaranteed to be at least
     one INPUT and the first INPUT does not begin with a '-', then the
     first '--' may be omitted.

     In the event that the string '--' is or may be an INPUT, the -e
     option may be used to change the end-of-inputs marker.  Note that
     this does _not_ change the end-of-options marker.  For example, to
     use '..' as the marker:

          zargs -e.. -- **/*(.) .. ls -l

     This is a good choice in that example because no plain file can be
     named '..', but the best end-marker depends on the circumstances.

     The options -i, -I, -l, -L, and -n differ slightly from their usage
     in xargs.  There are no input lines for zargs to count, so -l and
     -L count through the INPUT list, and -n counts the number of
     arguments passed to each execution of COMMAND, _including_ any ARG
     list.  Also, any time -i or -I is used, each INPUT is processed
     separately as if by '-L 1'.

     For details of the other zargs options, see man page xargs(1) (but
     note the difference in function between zargs and xargs) or run
     zargs with the --help option.

zed [ -f [ -x NUM ] ] NAME
zed -b
     This function uses the ZLE editor to edit a file or function.

     Only one NAME argument is allowed.  If the -f option is given, the
     name is taken to be that of a function; if the function is marked
     for autoloading, zed searches for it in the fpath and loads it.
     Note that functions edited this way are installed into the current
     shell, but _not_ written back to the autoload file.  In this case
     the -x option specifies that leading tabs indenting the function
     according to syntax should be converted into the given number of
     spaces; '-x 2' is consistent with the layout of functions
     distributed with the shell.

     Without -f, NAME is the path name of the file to edit, which need
     not exist; it is created on write, if necessary.

     While editing, the function sets the main keymap to zed and the vi
     command keymap to zed-vicmd.  These will be copied from the
     existing main and vicmd keymaps if they do not exist the first time
     zed is run.  They can be used to provide special key bindings used
     only in zed.

     If it creates the keymap, zed rebinds the return key to insert a
     line break and '^X^W' to accept the edit in the zed keymap, and
     binds 'ZZ' to accept the edit in the zed-vicmd keymap.

     The bindings alone can be installed by running 'zed -b'.  This is
     suitable for putting into a startup file.  Note that, if rerun,
     this will overwrite the existing zed and zed-vicmd keymaps.

     Completion is available, and styles may be set with the context
     prefix ':completion:zed'.

     A zle widget zed-set-file-name is available.  This can be called by
     name from within zed using '\ex zed-set-file-name' (note, however,
     that because of zed's rebindings you will have to type ^j at the
     end instead of the return key), or can be bound to a key in either
     of the zed or zed-vicmd keymaps after 'zed -b' has been run.  When
     the widget is called, it prompts for a new name for the file being
     edited.  When zed exits the file will be written under that name
     and the original file will be left alone.  The widget has no effect
     with 'zed -f'.

     While zed-set-file-name is running, zed uses the keymap
     zed-normal-keymap, which is linked from the main keymap in effect
     at the time zed initialised its bindings.  (This is to make the
     return key operate normally.)  The result is that if the main
     keymap has been changed, the widget won't notice.  This is not a
     concern for most users.

zcp [ -finqQvwW ] SRCPAT DEST
zln [ -finqQsvwW ] SRCPAT DEST
     Same as zmv -C and zmv -L, respectively.  These functions do not
     appear in the zsh distribution, but can be created by linking zmv
     to the names zcp and zln in some directory in your fpath.

zkbd
     See 'Keyboard Definition' (*note Utilities::).

zmv [ -finqQsvwW ] [ -C | -L | -M | -{p|P} PROGRAM ] [ -o OPTSTRING ]
    SRCPAT DEST
     Move (usually, rename) files matching the pattern SRCPAT to
     corresponding files having names of the form given by DEST, where
     SRCPAT contains parentheses surrounding patterns which will be
     replaced in turn by $1, $2, ...  in DEST.  For example,

          zmv '(*).lis' '$1.txt'

     renames 'foo.lis' to 'foo.txt', 'my.old.stuff.lis' to
     'my.old.stuff.txt', and so on.

     The pattern is always treated as an EXTENDED_GLOB pattern.  Any
     file whose name is not changed by the substitution is simply
     ignored.  Any error (a substitution resulted in an empty string,
     two substitutions gave the same result, the destination was an
     existing regular file and -f was not given) causes the entire
     function to abort without doing anything.

     In addition to pattern replacement, the variable $f can be
     referrred to in the second (replacement) argument.  This makes it
     possible to use variable substitution to alter the argument; see
     examples below.

     Options:

     -f
          Force overwriting of destination files.  Not currently passed
          down to the mv/cp/ln command due to vagaries of
          implementations (but you can use -o-f to do that).
     -i
          Interactive: show each line to be executed and ask the user
          whether to execute it.  'Y' or 'y' will execute it, anything
          else will skip it.  Note that you just need to type one
          character.
     -n
          No execution: print what would happen, but don't do it.
     -q
          Turn bare glob qualifiers off: now assumed by default, so this
          has no effect.
     -Q
          Force bare glob qualifiers on.  Don't turn this on unless you
          are actually using glob qualifiers in a pattern.
     -s
          Symbolic, passed down to ln; only works with -L.
     -v
          Verbose: print each command as it's being executed.
     -w
          Pick out wildcard parts of the pattern, as described above,
          and implicitly add parentheses for referring to them.
     -W
          Just like -w, with the addition of turning wildcards in the
          replacement pattern into sequential ${1} ..  ${N} references.
     -C
     -L
     -M
          Force cp, ln or mv, respectively, regardless of the name of
          the function.
     -p PROGRAM
          Call PROGRAM instead of cp, ln or mv.  Whatever it does, it
          should at least understand the form
               PROGRAM -- OLDNAME NEWNAME
          where OLDNAME and NEWNAME are filenames generated by zmv.
          PROGRAM will be split into words, so might be e.g.  the name
          of an archive tool plus a copy or rename subcommand.
     -P PROGRAM
          As -p PROGRAM, except that PROGRAM does not accept a following
          -- to indicate the end of options.  In this case filenames
          must already be in a sane form for the program in question.
     -o OPTSTRING
          The OPTSTRING is split into words and passed down verbatim to
          the cp, ln or mv command called to perform the work.  It
          should probably begin with a '-'.

     Further examples:

          zmv -v '(* *)' '${1// /_}'

     For any file in the current directory with at least one space in
     the name, replace every space by an underscore and display the
     commands executed.

          zmv -v '* *' '${f// /_}'

     This does exactly the same by referring to the file name stored in
     $f.

     For more complete examples and other implementation details, see
     the zmv source file, usually located in one of the directories
     named in your fpath, or in Functions/Misc/zmv in the zsh
     distribution.

zrecompile
     See 'Recompiling Functions' (*note Utilities::).

zstyle+ CONTEXT STYLE VALUE [ + SUBCONTEXT STYLE VALUE ... ]
     This makes defining styles a bit simpler by using a single '+' as a
     special token that allows you to append a context name to the
     previously used context name.  Like this:

          zstyle+ ':foo:bar' STYLE1 VALUE1 \
                 +':baz'     STYLE2 VALUE2 \
                 +':frob'    STYLE3 VALUE3

     This defines STYLE1 with VALUE1 for the context :foo:bar as usual,
     but it also defines STYLE2 with VALUE2 for the context :foo:bar:baz
     and STYLE3 with VALUE3 for :foo:bar:frob.  Any SUBCONTEXT may be
     the empty string to re-use the first context unchanged.

26.11.2 Styles
--------------

insert-tab
     The zed function _sets_ this style in context ':completion:zed:*'
     to turn off completion when TAB is typed at the beginning of a
     line.  You may override this by setting your own value for this
     context and style.

pager
     The nslookup function looks up this style in the context
     ':nslookup' to determine the program used to display output that
     does not fit on a single screen.

prompt
rprompt
     The nslookup function looks up this style in the context
     ':nslookup' to set the prompt and the right-side prompt,
     respectively.  The usual expansions for the PS1 and RPS1 parameters
     may be used (see *note Prompt Expansion::).
